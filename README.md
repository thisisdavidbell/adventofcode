# General Tips
- plan out code with comments/functions first
- consider just writing the dumb code to get something working, which often reveals the unseen flaws/gotchas/opportunities. Also, perf aspects often not revealed in part1.
- repeat for part2
  - plan changes with comments before making changes
  - just get a solution together, which often reveals the unseen flaws/gotchas/opportunities.
- Performance improvements:
  - critique the performance of the design
  - benchmark/profile the code to confirm the expensive parts
  - review the code
- plan out the enhancements with comments etc before changing the code
